对于时域离散系统，其描述方式包括：
\begin{itemize}
  \item 差分方程
  \item 单位脉冲响应$h(n)$
  \item 系统函数$H(z)$
\end{itemize}
%$$\underbrace{h(n)}_{\mbox{单位脉冲响应}}\Longleftrightarrow \underbrace{H(z)}_{\mbox{系统函数}}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{差分方程}
如果系统输入输出满足$N$阶差分方程：
$$
y(n)=\sum_{i=0}^{M}b_ix(n-i) - \sum_{i=1}^{N}a_iy(n-i)
$$
\par 则其系统函数$H(z)$为：
$$H(z)=\frac{Y(z)}{X(z)}= \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{M}
b_iz^{-i}}{1+\sum_{i=1}^{N}a_i z^{-i}}$$
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%
%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[shrink]\frametitle{}
\par 简单的推导如下：
对差分方程两边取ZT可得：
$$
ZT\left[y(n)\right]=ZT\left[\sum_{i=0}^{M}b_ix(n-i)\right] - ZT\left[ \sum_{i=1}^{N}a_iy(n-i)\right]
$$
$$Y(z)=\sum_{i=0}^{M}b_iz^{-i}X(z) - \sum_{i=1}^{N}a_iz^{-i}Y(z)$$
$$Y(z)\left (1 + \sum_{i=1}^{N}a_iz^{-i}\right ) =\sum_{i=0}^{M}b_iz^{-i}X(z)$$
%$\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\therefore\quad\quad$
$$\therefore\quad\quad
H(z)=\frac{Y(z)}{X(z)}= \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{M}b_iz^{-i}}{1+\sum_{i=1}^{N}a_iz^{-i}}$$

\par 对于同一数字系统，其差分方程与系统函数是等价的。

\begin{frame}\frametitle{FIR系统的基本网络结构的特点}%[allowframebreaks]

FIR网络结构特点是：\par

\textbf{没有反馈支路，即没有环路。}所以，其单位脉冲响应$h(n)$必定是有限长。
\newline

设其长度为N，则其系统函数为：
$$H(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1}h(n)z^{-n}=\sum_{n=n_1}^{n_2}h(n)z^{-n}$$
%\par 可见$H(z)$是$z^{-1}$为自变量的N-1阶多项式。
%\par 即：
%$$H(z)=\frac{a_0z^{N-1}+a_1z^{N-2}+\cdots+a_{N-1}}{z^{N-1}}\quad\quad
%\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad$$
%\par $\therefore\quad$$z=0$是$H(z)$的$N-1$阶极点。
第二章曾经指出，有限长序列的z变换，当$n_1\geq0,n_2>0$时，其收敛域为$0<|z|\leq\infty$。
可见其收敛域必然包括单位圆。

$$H(e^{j\omega})= |H(e^{j\omega})|\cdot e^{j\varphi(\omega)}$$
